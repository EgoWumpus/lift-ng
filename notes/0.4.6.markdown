* Minor correction to resolution for [Issue #1](https://github.com/joescii/lift-ng/issues/1) to correctly allow messages to begin dequeuing without waiting for a new message.
* Added `includeJsScript` parameter to `Angular.init()` to give developers the ability to download the `liftproxy.js` their own way, such as via [head.js](http://headjs.com/).
* Updated closure compiler.
