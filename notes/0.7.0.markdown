#liftng

#scala @liftweb @angularjs

Optimized serialization of `Future`.
Previously in our JSON object we created a field named `net.liftmodules.ng.Angular.future` set to the value `true` followed by an `id` field with our randomly generated identifier.
These two have been merged into one field named `net.liftmodules.ng.Angular.future` with the value being the random identifier.
