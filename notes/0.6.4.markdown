#scala @liftweb @angularjs

This release of lift-ng corrects a race condition where an embedded `Future` or `LAFuture` which happened to resolve during JSON serialization would never arrive on the client.
Added a developer `WARN` server console message for when the client sends invalid json.
The message asks the developer if they remembered to extend `NgModel` which is a super common root cause of the problem, and very frustrating to diagnose.
