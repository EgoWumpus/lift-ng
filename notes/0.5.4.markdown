**BREAKING CHANGE:** Renamed `BindingActor` to `NgModelBinder`.

Decomposed `NgModelBinder` so it is possible to specify:

 * `BindingDirection` by mixing in `BindingToClient`, `BindingToServer`, or both for 2-way binding
 * `BindingScope` which defaults to per-request (i.e. per page load) and can be scoped to the session like the original `BindingActor` behavior by mixing in `SessionScope`
